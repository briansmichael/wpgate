# Whispering Pines Gate - User's Guide

## System Overview
The Whispering Pines Trail gate has been in place for many years with several methods by which the gate might be opened.
1. Entering a code into the key pad outside the gate
2. Pressing a button on a remote/key fob (similar to opening a garage door)
3. Driving near a sensor embedded in the ground on the east side of the road between the gate and mailboxes
In addition to these methods, another method of open the gate has been added, which allows both guests and residents to interact with the gate via text messages using their cell phones.

## Guests
Guests are any individual for which that individual's cell phone number is not recognized by the gate text message system.  
Upon arrival of a guest at the gate, the guest has the options of entering a code into the keypad, waiting for another gate user to open the gate, or send a message to the gate text message system, which will relay that message to a homeowner within the community.  The message sent by the guest must be in the format of "<<house number>> <<message>>".  For example: "3021, This is George from Amazon, please open the gate."  To help facilitate guests in creating messages in this format, a QR code and a brief message located near the keypad will be provided to assist the guest.
Upon the guest sending their message, the text message system will check it's database to ensure the user is in fact a guest, and relay the "<<message>>" portion of the guest's message to the home owners at the address denoted by the "<<house number>>" portion of the guest's message.  For example: "3021, This is George from Amazon, please open the gate." will send the message "This is George from Amazon, please open the gate. (sent from 4048675309)" to all homeowners of the property located at 3021.  If no property exists at 3021, then the guest will receive a response indicating that their message was incorrect, and that they may try again.

### Example Guest Scenario
1. Guest arrives at the gate and scans the QR code using their cell phone.
2. The QR code pre-populates a text message in the guest's phone with the gate's text message system's phone number and the message "<<house number>> This is <<guest name>>, please open the gate."
3. The guest replaces the <<house number>> and <<guest name>> portions of the message with whatever information is relevant to their visit, and sends the message
4. The gate text message system receives and analyzes the mesage.  If deemed valid, then forwards the message to the home owner(s) of the property specified
5. If (any of) the home owner(s) responds to the text message system (see resident portion of this guide), then the gate is opened, and the guest is allowed entry into the community.

## Residents
Residents are any individuals for which that individual's cell phone number is recognized by the gate text message system.  There are 3 levels of access privilege within the Resident categorization of users.
1. Resident
2. Owner
3. Admin
